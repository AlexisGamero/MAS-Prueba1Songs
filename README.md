## Installation:
Create a new folder under %path_to_DDLC%/game/Submods/ and name it "Prueba1Songs". Then, copy the songs that you want to the folder.
Once you have done that, wait until Monika sings the song you want to hear, and enjoy!

## Please note: the songs in the WIP folder are not finished! Using these songs in MAS may lead you to encounter a variety of issues, such as the game crashing, typos, freezing, etc. Please be patient and wait until the songs are finished to use them in MAS.
