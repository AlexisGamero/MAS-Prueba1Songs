Create a new folder under %path_to_DDLC%/game/Submods/ and name it "Prueba1Songs". Then, copy the songs that you want to the folder.
Once you have done that, wait until Monika sings the song you want to hear, and enjoy!

## Please note: the songs in the WIP folder are not finished! Using these songs in MAS may cause issues, so please wait until they are finished to use them, thank you!
